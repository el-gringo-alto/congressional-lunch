# Congressional Lunch

[Congressional Lunch](http://www.congressional-lunch.com/) is a website that generates fake tweets from congressmen based on their party.


## Gallery Instructions

When viewed in a gallery setting, this piece is to be a three channel installation. On all three monitors will be a maximized browser window and will display the following urls:
* Left: http://congressional-lunch/tile?header=false&party=democratic
* Center: http://congressional-lunch/?header=false
* Right: http://congressional-lunch/tile?header=false&party=republican

A screen-recording of those pages should be created prior to installation in the gallery space. This is to ensure the piece can still be displayed even if the gallery is unable to accommodate the installation requirements. Please note that the fake tweets are generated primarily from real tweets posted in the past week, therefore a video will not represent current events as the project was intended to do. This should only be implemented as a last resort.
